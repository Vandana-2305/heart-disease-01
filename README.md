# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction – Decision Tree & Random Forest (Task 5)

This project applies tree-based models to classify heart disease using the Heart Disease dataset.

---

## ✅ Task Summary:

- Trained a **Decision Tree** model
- Visualized the tree structure
- Controlled overfitting using `max_depth`
- Trained a **Random Forest** model
- Compared accuracy between models
- Analyzed **Feature Importances**
- Used **Cross-Validation** to evaluate model performance

---

## 📊 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTree, RandomForest, Metrics)

---

## 📁 Files Included:
- `heart.csv` – Dataset
- `Heart_Task5_DecisionTree_RF.ipynb` – Full notebook
- `README.md` – You’re reading it :)
